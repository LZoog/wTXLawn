          <p>Beautiful turfs. No heavy costs.</p>
          <p>Hydroseeding provides a greener, thicker, longer lasting, and more uniform lawn than sodding or hand seeding because the root is established deeper into the soil, creating an ideal growing environment capable of retaining 10 times its weight in water.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="benefit">
          <h1>Cost-effective<span class="nowrap"> & Quick</span></h1>
          <hr />
          <p>Faster and easier to install, hydroseeding will revive your lawn without the expense, time, material costs, or installation demands of sodding or hand seeing. Germination can occur as quickly as 7 days after installation thanks to slurry materials that enhance the process and stimulate seeds.</p>

          <h1>Erosion Control<span class="nowrap"> & Safety</h1>
          <hr />
          <p>Hydroseeding holds moisture deep into the ground and protects against soil loss from wind, rain, sun, and pests through binding seed, mulch, tackifiers, and other soil conditioners. It is a non-toxic and safe method of growing grass that is harmless to children, pets, and the environment.</p>
